# The Scientific Aspect of Writing



# Bias

# Terministic Screens

# Levels of Information Spectrue

## Green Zone

1. The facts _(actual Truth)_
   - The facts are the facts, regardless of what you believe.
2. Accurate reporting of the facts
   - Truth condensed and retold without bias
     - _pipe dream for some_
3. Reporting of the facts with mild-but-self-aware bias
   - Many people, even with training, tend to condense and report the truth.
4. Reporting of facts with clear bias
   - Facts are there, but personal slant leans toward advocacy and may require
     some filtering.

## Yellow Zone

5. Selective reporting of facts with strong bias
   - This style has ethical issues, but the facts that are reported are still accurate. However, details left out intentionally or false inferences are suggested.

## Orange Zone - Overlap of Yellow and Red

6. Satire
    - First level of Fake news, done intentionally and explicitly but for 
      entertainment or tongue in cheek. The audience knows it's fake.
      - _E.g. The Onion_

## Red Zone - Fake News

7. Uncritically sharing misinformation
   - Second level of Fake news
   - No intention to deceive, but failed at fact checking.
   - _E.g. sharing info from The Onion without realizing it's satire._
8. Sinister reporting
   - Third level of Fake News
   - Complete falsification of facts intentionally to mislead, often for political or economic gain.
   - _I.e. people make money off of the ads and site visits because of clickbait titles and sensational lies #fakenews._
