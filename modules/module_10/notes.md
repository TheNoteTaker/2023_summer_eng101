# General Notes

- Overlaps the linguistic and technological aspects of writing

# What is a Writing System

- A way that language or communication is structured or made cognitively
  comprehensible for users of that system.
    - The systems that we use so our brains can process information
- Writing systems and variations of these are built as part
  of specific macro- or micro-culture conventions.
- Writing systems develop both in larger societies over a period of centuries
  linked to major common languages and in very small settings, even special
  codes for friends.
- _Even secret handshakes with friends count as systems._

# Why Should We Try to Understand Writing Systems?

## Understanding Writing Systems

- Gives us insight into the logic behind the language.
- Helps a writer see rules as norms, so s/he can make conscious choices
  regarding which norms to adhere to.
- Understanding writing systems helps us get at the logic behind the language.
    - The logic behind how things are communicated.

## If we can decode systems of communications,

- We can speak into that context more effectively
- We can translate across systems.
- We can identify cultural values and social norms.

# How Do We Begin Seeing the Systems of Writing Around Us?

- Seeing the system and logic behind communication begins with identifying
  patterns in languages.
- Patterns can be found at a variety of levels and represented in a variety of
  ways, from parts of words (morphology) or phrases/sentences (syntax) to
  sections or whole document levels (genre).
- Linguists and literacy specialists call this process of patterning **Encoding
  and Decoding**

# Language Processes: Encoding and Decoding

## Encoding

- How we translate our individual language in our brains into a shared language
- How we embed information into various symbols, sounds, scripts, images, and/or
  physicality (body language) often intentionally with the hope that someone
  will be able to decode that information.
- Encoding is trying to create a language that others can understand.

## Decoding

- How we translate information that has been encoded into a shared language and
  reverse engineer it for personal understanding
                                                               
# Common Types of Writing Systems

- **Somatic (Physical)** - Finger counting, posturing, ASL
- **Alphabetic** - Alpha Beta (roman/greek alphabet systems)
- **Phonographic** - written/carved sounds
  - A sound-based system, not a sound-bass system
- **Phonological** - Ideas represented in sound form
  - Connected to Logos
- **Syllabic** - Written/carved syllables
- **Pictographic** - Written/carved picture
- **Logographic** - Carved out ideas 
  - _E.g. heart for love_
  - Based on more symbolic meanings rather than literal.
- **Numeric** - Number-based systems
- Sub-culture specific language




- Math is multiple languages
- Math is **not** a universal language.
  - Different cultures have different ways of doing math, such as dealing with counting and abstract concepts.
- Numbers are abstract until they are tied to something concrete like a unit of measurement.
- There are many ways to write even the number 144.
- Mathematics uses linguistic components:
  - Morphemes and morphology
    - x, y, 5, 9, A, B, +, =, *, %
- Math language is rhetorical and socio-cultural
  - Math has common structures, forms, and patterns of communication
  - The audience has certain expectations that are based on the culture of math and rhetorical context
  - Math uses specific genres
  - y = mx + b, A = &pi;r<sup>2</sup>, C = 2&pi;r
  - These are generic structures for math communications. Because they have not been applied to specific contexts, they are not "texts" yet. The same way IMRD is a genre.
