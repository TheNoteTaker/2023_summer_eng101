# Writing Conventions

The first step as a writer in socio-cultural is understanding when beliefs have turned into audience expectations/social norms or full-fledged conventions.

- When discussing writing conventions, most will think of citations styles and often stop there.
- APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, et cetera
- Genre conventions at multiple levels:
  - **Linguistic:** Syntax structure, spelling, punctuation
  - **Structure conventions:** preferred organization/order
  - **Rhetorical conventions:** preferred ways to accomplish writer purpose
  - **Scientific Conventions:** beliefs about what counts
  as knowledge in a society

# Power Dynamics

- You want to think about who has authority and the type of authority over you as a writer and your readers.
- **Hegemony**
- Types of **Authority**/Authorities
  - Established authorities (more permanent)
    - Longer term and harder to get rid of as an authority
    - _I.g. Your parents_
  - Temporary authorities - official
    - _I.g. Your boss when you are at work_
  - Allowed/relinquished authority - personal
    - Personal submission or choosing to listen to someone.
    - Very good for grassroots movements.
- **Agency** - the individual’s decision-making power
  - We are enacting our agency power to choose who we listen to.
- **Stakeholders** (ties to the analytical aspect)
- **Power documents**/ Key textual artifacts
- A government’s constitution, laws, syllabus, textbook, employee handbook, code of conduct, etc.
