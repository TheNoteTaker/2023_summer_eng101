# Exigence


- The meaning of **exigence/exigency** is from the Latin noun _exigentia_, which means "urgency" and comes from the verb _exigere_, meaning "to demand or require."
  - An emergency situation, or exigency, is urgent and demands immediate action.
  - Basically defined as "Why I write right now."
  - A writer's motivation for writing
- This is also often linked to the rhetorically principle of **Kairos** _(the timely moment)_
  - Finding the most appropriate time to respond to the trigger **exigence**.
    - _I.e. nailing the punchline of a joke_
    - _I.e. There is an appropriate time socially to make a joke and that time may pass in only moments_
  - People know of ethos, pathos, logos, but not kairos

- **Purpose** is having something you believe and want to write about
- **Exigency** is having something that triggered you to do it <u>now</u>.
  - Why is right now the right time to discuss this thing, with this audience, in this time and place?

- **Exigency** is the trigger to get you moving and **kairos** is the timeframe that is the appropriate time to respond to the trigger.

values for communicating
