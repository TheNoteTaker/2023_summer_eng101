  - Political rhetoric
    - This type ties back to Aristotelian rhetoric, born in the Greek agora.
  - Rhetorical questions
- It's important to know the classical Greek rhetorical macrostructures and forms, because in comparison to other forms because knowing that history might change what we view as effective writing, communication, or rhetoric in the Western culture of Europe and the US. 
- Much of western rhetoric is based on Aristotelian rhetoric, which is masculine and aggressive argument, speech, and debate is about winning the debate and proving the other person wrong.
  - Feminist rhetorical practices and Rogerian models are different from this and aim to truly convince someone by walking them through the argument and showing them the truth.
