# What is Linguistics?

- The scientific study of human language.
- The aims of linguistic theory:
    - What is knowledge of language? _**(Competence)**_
    - How is knowledge of language acquired? _**(Acquisition)**_
    - How is knowledge of language put to use?
      _**(Performance/language processing)**_
- Linguists and applied linguists spend their lives studying language and how it
  works (not always human, most often).
- Some linguists only study one component of linguistics for a single language
  or language variety.
- Language is more than just "English, Spanish, etc". The principles used are
  applicable across dialects, languages, and varieties.

## Grammar

A **grammar** includes everything one knows about the structure of one’s
language:

> - **Phonetics and Phonology** (the sounds and the sound system or patterns)
> - **Lexicon** (the words or vocabulary in the mental dictionary)
> - **Morphology** (the structure of words)
> - **Syntax** (the structure of phrases and sentences and the constraints on
    > well-formedness of sentences)
> - **Semantics** (the meaning of words and sentences)

- When we are describing ourselves as having bad grammar, we're really
  describing our ability to align ourselves with a specific cultural norm,
  language norm or convention.
    - We're not talking about grammar the way a linguist would, we're talking
      about the rules of grammar established by a particular people group.
        - This is not a good way to look at grammar.
        - It's important to shift your thinking of grammar to how linguists see
          it: The patterns in language that are common when people share
          language resources.
- Some people intentionally break the rules of grammar to make an identity claim
  in their papers or to make a point.

## Phonetics and Phonology

### Phonetics

**Phonetics** studies speech sounds, including the production of speech, that
is how speech sounds are actually made, transmitted and received, the
description and classification of speech sounds, words and connected speech,
etc.

- We tend to imagine ourselves as unaccented, but we all form our words in a
  unique way.

Another thing that people are familiar with when it comes to phonetics is tongue
twisters and Homophones.

- _Homophones_ are words that sound the same but have different meanings.
- It can be really effective to work on tongue twisters in various languages as
  it forces out brains to focus on where the sounds come from and how they are
  made.

Phonetics applies to us as writers because spoken languages were developed
before written and so we often learn to speak languages before writing them.

- We will often write how we are used to hearing. So if we read it how we heard
  it, it may not make sense.
    - For first time learners, words may sound off or wrong with a different
      language background.
- **The Logic of English** is a good book for learning more about this.
- As we learn the phonetics of our own language, we can learn to better hear
  other accents and improve our communication.
    - For example, people who replace letters with other letters and how those
      sounds are being formed. Understanding how sounds are formed can help us
      understand what people are saying and how better to speak in other
      languages.
