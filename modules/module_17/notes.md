# The Aesthetic Aspect of Writing

## Aesthetics

- **In philosophy**, Aesthetics is a “set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty, especially in art.”
- When we discuss this in writing, this links most commonly to a few major emphases in writing...
  - Reflective Writing / Emotive Writing
  - Literature
  - Creative Writing

## Aesthetic Values of Writing

- When a writing is:
  - Interesting....Fun....Exciting....Entertaining
  - Boring...Dull...Plain...Bland
- When a writing triggers **emotional** responses _(links to pathos)_
- When it helps us **experience** something or connects with **sensory perception** through words or language or visual design
- When writing is **entertaining** or **expressive**

## Overview of Key Components

- **STORY**
  - Literature / Creative Writing
- **POETICS / STYLISTICS**
  - Language Play through stylistic devices (metaphor, metonymy, rhyme, et cetera)

# Titles and Attention Grabbers

- An attention grabber is like a pickup line. 
- Three things you can do for an **attention grabber**:
  1. Ask a question
     - Avoid second-person
     - _"Does a person really need XYZ"_
  2. Use a famous quote
     - The quote is from a person connected to the topic or is directly connected to the topic
     - Do not use a random one.
  3. Use an anecdote
     - Don't use too much story or else it won't feel like a research paper
       - 2 - 3 sentences and tangible, concrete, and specific to the topic.
- The point of the attention grabber is not to make an argument, it's to get the reader to want to read your argument.
- The title is another place for an attention grabber. A clickbait-like title is not always bad as long as you don't oversell.
- Try to think associatively when thinking of aesthetics, tying it to people's experiences and emotions.
