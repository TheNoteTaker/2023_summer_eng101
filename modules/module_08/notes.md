# General Notes

# Structuring Arguments - Rhetorical Forms

- **Classical**
    - _Classical Greek Oratorical Form_
- **Rogerian**
- **Toulmin**
- **Imrad**
    - _More of a scientific lab report_
    - _Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion_

# Classical Greek Oratorical Form

- **Exordium**
    - Introduces problem/win audience
- **Narratio**
    - Tells story of problem (the context)
- **Partitio**
    - Breaks down basic argument
- **Confirmatio**
    - Backs up argument hardcore
- **Refutatio**
    - Recognizes alternate views and drops the hammer on it
- **Peroratio**
    - Summarizes argument and lights a fire under the audience (figuratively)

---

- The first three sections of exordium, narratio, and partitio are only **15% -
  20%** of the essay.
- This is an aggressive form with just enough information to get them to what
  you think, very pushy and forward.
    - This is something that is great for winning arguments, but bad at winning
      friends. This tends to become embedded in the way that we argue as well.

# Rogerian Form

Based on a clinical counseling method desiring to incite compassion and
reconciliation between parties

- This is not a full _compromise_ model where you submit to a way of thinking
  you don't agree with, it's a form of rhetoric that establishes **ethos** over
  **logos**.
- This form emphasizes passion and being a human over winning a debate.
- This form is influence versus authority, because you have established a
  cultural respect around you.
    - People that we allow to have influence over us versus people who are
      forced to.

## Key Rhetorical Moves

- Introduce issue, problem, or argument
- Give Context
- Validate alternate views
    - _This is not agreeing or confirming, it's validating._
- State Oneâ€™s Own Opinion
- Explain Benefits to opponents

# Giving Feedback: RICE Model

1. **Relationship** and **Rapport-building**
    - Connect with the audience and establish a relationship
2. **Information** or **Illustration**
    - Provide the information, pattern, illustration, or example from their
      writing that you want to address.
    - Be specific in pointing out what you are addressing.
3. **Claim**
    - Say whether you think it was effective or not and to what degree.
4. **Explanation**
    - Explain why you think the above, and give the recommendation for
      improvement.

- Built on the Rogerian form
- Give feedback that is specific, tangible, and offers recommendations.
- Similar to the compliment sandwich
- Look for patterns of things people are doing well and things they are not,
  instead of just individual things.
    - You can focus on a specific aspect of writing.
- Build people up, don't beat them up.

## The Professor's Grading System

- Once papers are submitted, students will receive **3 - 6** papers to give feedback on, meaning they do **3 -6** (likely **3 - 4**) assessments.
  - The feedback they give will count for **5%** of their grade.
- Students must give a numerical score for **9 criteria**:
  1. Eight aspects of writing
     - **0 - 10 Score** where **10** is excellent.
     - This totals for **80 points**
  2. Basic requirement for the assignment
     - This accounts for **20 points**
     - This asks if the student met the basic requirements of the assignment and fulfilled the main purpose of the assignment.
     - Can also include, sources, formatting, word count, etc.
- Students must also give three substantial paragraph-length pieces of feedback of **3 - 6 sentences** or **4 - 7 sentences** each.
- The instructor may adjust the scores if he feels that something was missed.
- The final part of this is for you to defend your work if needed while the teacher abritrates between you and the other students.
