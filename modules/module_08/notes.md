# Classical Greek Oratorical Form

- **Exordium**
    - Introduces problem/win audience
- **Narratio**
    - Tells story of problem (the context)
- **Partitio**
    - Breaks down basic argument
- **Confirmatio**
    - Backs up argument hardcore
- **Refutatio**
    - Recognizes alternate views and drops the hammer on it
- **Peroratio**
    - Summarizes argument and lights a fire under the audience (figuratively)

---

- The first three sections of exordium, narratio, and partitio are only **15% -
20%** of the essay.
- This is an aggressive form with just enough information to get them to what you think, very pushy and forward.
  - This is something that is great for winning arguments, but bad at winning friends. This tends to become embedded in the way that we argue as well.
