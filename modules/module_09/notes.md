# General Notes

## 16 Organization Strategies

> [16 organization strategies - PDF Link](assets/16-organization-strategies.pdf)

### Overview

- Organization strategies help in structuring the ideas and points in an essay.
- The choice of strategy depends on the purpose of the essay.
- These strategies are tools to communicate ideas clearly and are not goals in
  themselves.

### Strategies

1. **Time Order (Chronological Order)**
    - Useful for narrating personal events, historical events, explaining
      processes, or tracing complex causes and effects.
    - **_Example:_** _"First, my wife hit me. Then, she stabbed me. I called 911
      for help. Finally, we made arrangements for marital counseling."_
2. **Spatial Order**
    - Useful for describing a scene, a room, a person, or a technical layout. It
      can also explain how parts of a machine fit together or how a team
      operates.
    - **_Example:_** _Description of how dirty farm labor can be, from shoes to
      hair._
3. **General to Specific**
    - Begins by discussing a general trend or problem, and gradually narrows the
      focus.
    - **_Example:_** _Discussion of romantic triangles as a plot device in
      British literature, narrowing down to a specific book and part of the
      book._
4. **Comparison / Contrast**
    - Systematically goes through point-by-point comparison, contrast, or both.
    - **_Example:_** _Comparison and contrast between Lady Jane Grey and Queen
      Elizabeth I._
5. **Abstract to Concrete**
    - Compares a difficult or abstract concept to a common, everyday phenomenon.
    - **_Example:_** _Comparison of the theory of quantum mechanics to a card
      game._
6. **Importance**
    - Moves from the least important point or item toward items of increasing
      importance.
    - **_Example:_** _If a room caught fire, the order of items to save based on
      their importance._
7. **Magician's Trick**
    - A variant of "Importance", where the second-best point is first, the best
      point is last, and everything else is in the middle.
    - Useful for having a strong introduction and a memorable conclusion.

### Conclusion

- These strategies can be experimented with and should not restrict the writing
  process.
- The goal is to communicate an idea in a clear, intelligible manner.

## 11 Common Commas

> [11 common commas - PDF Link](assets/11-common_commas.pdf)

### Common Comma Usage

1. **Introductory Clauses**
    - _**Rule:**_
        - Use a comma to offset any grouping of 3+ words coming before the
          grammatical subject of a sentence.
        - Exception: Less than 3 words is recommended but not required.
    - **_Structure:_** `Intro, (S)ubject (V)erb`.
    - **_Example:_** "After looking under the couch, I hopelessly sat down."
2. **Coordinating Conjunctions (F.A.N.B.O.Y.S.)**
    - **_Rule:_**
        - A comma is necessary when a sentence contains two independent
          clauses (Subject-Verb) which are connected by one of these joining
          words (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)
    - **_Structure:_** `(S1)ubject (V1)erb, (CC) (S2)ubject (V2)erb`.
    - **_Example:_** "The journal article opened my eyes, but now I needed
      sunglasses."
3. **Parenthetical / Non-Essential Phrases / Interjections**
    - **_Rule:_**
        - Use commas to offset extra information/insertions that are not
          necessary but may be helpful for your reader.
    - **_Possible Structures:_**
        - `S, P, V`
        - `Intro, S V, P`
        - `S1 V1 , P, CC S2 , P,V2, P`
    - **_Example:_** "My mom, the lawyer, baked cookies."
4. **Lists of Items**
    - **_List Rule 1:_**
        - Use commas to separate a (3+) series of equivalent/parallel items,
          actions, or dependent phrases.
    - **_Possible Structures:_**
        - `S V L1, L2, L3, and L4`
        - `S=(L1, L2, and L3 ) V`
    - _**Example:**_ "One’s writing should be concise, specific, interesting,
      and
      engaging."
    - **_List Rule 2:_**
        - Use commas to separate equal adjectives(A) that describe the same
          noun(N).
    - **_Possible Structures:_**
        - `(A1, A2) S V`
        - `S V (A1, A2) N`
    - _**Example**:_ "The sleek, red car sped by."

### Key Takeaways

- Comma usage is critical in English writing for clarity and meaning.
- The four common uses of commas include introductory clauses, coordinating
  conjunctions, parenthetical phrases, and lists of items.
- Understanding and applying these rules can significantly improve the
  readability and effectiveness of your writing.

### How to Reduce Errors in Your Writing

1. **Write first and edit later**: The less you think about grammar while you
   are writing, the more fluent your writing will be and the fewer mistakes you
   will make.
2. **Give yourself time**: You will notice much more if you wait, after you are
   done drafting, before you go back to edit.
3. **Print your paper out**: It makes it easier to see typos and other errors
   than when you look at your work on a screen.
4. **Read your writing out loud**: Your ear can often hear more than your eye
   can see.
5. **Read your work backwards**: Start with the last sentence, then read the
   next-to-last sentence, and so on.
6. **Find someone who will help you look over your writing**: Because you are so
   close to your own writing, a reader will always be able to see things that
   you cannot.
7. **Read more. Read well-written prose**: We learn language best through
   immersion.
8. **Focus on one error at a time**: If you know you have trouble with commas,
   once you know that the rest of your paper is revised the way you want it, go
   through your paper and just focus on that.

### Identifying Errors to Focus On

- What errors have instructors pointed out in your work in the past?
- Has your instructor mentioned any errors that particularly bother them?
- What errors do you worry about the most?
